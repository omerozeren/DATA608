Course: Knowledge and Visual Analytics (Data 608)

Purpose 
--------
  The purpose of final project is to visualize suicide rates and correlations between
  GDP per capita by country and profile of suicides among different cohorts globally.

Visualization
--------------
  
  The project includes the following aspects of the Analysis of Global
Suicide Rate:
  
  -  Correlation of suicide rate and GDP per capita by country from 1985
to 2016 years.

-  Suicide rate by country from 1985 to 2016 years (Slides tab added).

-  Suicide rate distribution by country (World Geographical Map).


Analysis
---------
  
  -  Suicide rate shows decreasing trend globally.

-  There is no strong correlation between suicide rate and GDP per capita. However several countries have some kind of negative correlation between suicide rate and GDP per capita.

-  The dominant suicide age group is 75 + years, the dominant sex group - men.

-  Women's suicide rate significantly lower than man's suicide rate.

-  The highest suicide rate is in Lithuania - 40, the rest countries in the list of the countries with the highest suicide rate are developing northern countries (except Sri Lanka).


Limitations
-----------
  
  The "Data" Tab consumes extra time to load project data(takes 1-1.5 minutes to see the tab result)


Tools Used:
-----------

Shiny App, Plotly API, R

Correlation Input Variable Used:
--------------------------------
  
  - GDP per Capita - is a measure of a country's economic output that
accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross
domestic product by its total population.

- Suicide Rate - number of suicides per 100k of population.

  Shinyapps (link to the deployed project): http://omerozeren.shinyapps.io/final_project/
  
  Course: Knowledge and Visual Analytics (Data 608)

Purpose 
--------
  The purpose of final project is to visualize suicide rates and correlations between
  GDP per capita by country among different cohorts globally.

Visualization
--------------
  
  The project includes the following aspects of the Analysis of Global
Suicide Rate:
  
  -  Correlation of suicide rate and GDP per capita by country and in aggregationfrom 1985
to 2016 years.

-  Dynamic profile of suicides by country from 1985 to 2016 years (animation added).

-  Suicide rate distribution by country (World Choropleth Map).

Insights
---------
  
  -  Suicide rate shows decreasing trend globally.

-  There is no strong correlation between suicide rate and GDP per capita. However several countries have some kind of negative correlation between suicide rate and GDP per capita.

-  The dominant suicide age group is 75 + years, the dominant sex group - men.

-  Women's suicide rate significantly lower than man's suicide rate.

-  The highest suicide rate is in Lithuania - 40, the rest countries in the list of the countries with the highest suicide rate are developing northern countries (except Sri Lanka).

Limitations
-----------
  
  Suicide rate statistics is not available for several countries.


Visualization Tools Used: Shiny App, Plotly API, R

Terminology Used:
  
  - GDP per Capita - is a measure of a country's economic output that
accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross
domestic product by its total population.

- Suicide Rate - number of suicides per 100k of population.

Possible Further Analysis: correlation of number of sunny days per year vs suicide rate by country.
